There is my code example here. eMia is an application like a forum. You can register, then post topics with a title, description and a photo.
There are profile editor, push-notification if another user likes your post.

eMia developed with using 
- Firebase database, storage, authentication and cloud messages.
- RxSwift
- RxCocoa, RxDatasource and Custom Layout for UICollectionView
- VIPER arhitecture

## Requirements

- Xcode 9.3
- Swift 4

## Introduction

If you want to try eMia, sign in your Google account, then open Firebase console https://console.firebase.google.com
Create a new project. Please follow documentations https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup#add_firebase_to_your_app.
As a result you have to download GoogleService-Info.plist file and replace my current.
